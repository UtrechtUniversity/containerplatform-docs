> Because our jira/confluence is behind a login, we cannot use an <code>iframe</code> to show the roadmap here.  
> We want to have 'one source of truth' for our roadmap, therefore we have chosen to link to the roadmap instead.  
> You need to have access to the Utrecht University Jira/Confluence environment to view the roadmap.  
> If you do not have access, you can request access after you clicked the aforementioned link.
