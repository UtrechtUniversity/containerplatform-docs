???+ warning "Upcoming changes"
    We are building and configuring new loadbalancers for the OpenShift cluster.
    This is almost done, and we are currently testing the new loadbalancers. We are also creating documentation about this, which will be available soon on this site.
    We are also in the process of setting up Harica as a certificate authority for TLS certificates.
    There will be changes needed in your code, and we will provide you with the necessary information to make these changes.
    We will keep you updated on the progress of this work, in our stakeholder meetings and via email.
    So don't worry, everything will stay the same for now, and we will make sure you have all the information you need to make the changes.
