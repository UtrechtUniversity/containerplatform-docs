# Test & Quality Services

Within Utrecht University, we have a dedicated TQS department (Test & Quality Services) that can support end users with testing their applications. We would like to refer you to this team for further assistance.

TQS plays a key role in helping teams maintain control over the quality of their IT projects, processes, and products. They provide a range of services and tools designed to manage and safeguard quality throughout the entire lifecycle of both new and existing systems and applications—from the initial analysis and design phases to (automated) testing and operational support.

Their end-to-end approach ensures that all relevant information is gathered early, requirements are clearly defined, and the needs of the end user are fully understood. They help assess how users experience a product or service and whether it aligns with organisational goals.

TQS develops tailored test strategies, executes both manual and automated tests, and provides expert test advice to ensure optimal quality of the final result. Their specialists know which methodologies and working practices best fit specific challenges, allowing projects to remain focused, adaptive, and efficient.

TQS offers services in the following areas:
	•	User Experience
	•	Business Analysis
	•	Testing & Test Automation
	•	Agile

If you need support with application testing or quality assurance, the TQS department is the right place to contact.
